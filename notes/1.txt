sort out land use issue
- coarse scale (landuse database)
- fine scale (study surveys?)
- google earth?

standardise richness by area
- might need to look up some equation to do this with to account for non-linear relationship

Check out Stein et al. 2009 as source of climate/topography/geology variables.

Partial constrained correspondence analysis to work out contribution of hydrological / environmental / land use variables


Do average trait expressions of a priori groups of species (e.g. invasives) respond differently than the rest of the community
-CWM-RDA

Is the response to the environment of a priori groups of species (e.g. invasive vs. non-invasive) related to the same traits?




can between replicate variation be attributed to localised land use?
