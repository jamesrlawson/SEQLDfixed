SEQLD paper review:

cross-validate imputation
play with adjusting p-values before selecting predictors for multiple regression models
think about how to get the data published as a supp.
read suggested references + search for some new refs
think about how position in the river network might influence results...
	- can I get data for this?
should email Cassie James at some point too

# imputed values are best when all other traits have values
# could perhaps just use imputed values where all other values are filled
# or at provide estimates of error for cases where 1, 2, 3 other values are missing
could provide scatter plots w correlation coeff's between actual and imputed vals. Could subset by # of values missing for spp. too
that sounds like probably the best visual representation of how well the imputation is performing
